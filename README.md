---

### Step 1️⃣1️⃣: Install Stress Tool on EC2

Installed the **stress-ng** utility on the EC2 instance to generate artificial CPU load for testing the CloudWatch alarm behavior.

---

### Step 1️⃣2️⃣: Alarm in OK State (Before Load)

Verified that the CloudWatch alarm was initially in the **OK** state before generating CPU load.

* * *

### Step 1️⃣3️⃣: Generate High CPU Load

Executed the stress test to increase CPU usage on the EC2 instance using the stress-ng tool.

### Step 1️⃣4️⃣: Alarm Triggered (In Alarm State)

Observed the CloudWatch alarm transition from **OK** to **In Alarm** state due to high CPU utilization.

![Alarm Triggered](screenshots/14-cloudwatch-alarm-triggered.png)

* * *

### Step 1️⃣5️⃣: High CPU Metrics Observed

Confirmed that CPU utilization exceeded the defined alarm threshold in CloudWatch metrics.

* * *

### Step 1️⃣6️⃣: CloudWatch Dashboard Creation

Created a CloudWatch dashboard to visualize EC2 metrics and alarm status in real time.

![CloudWatch Dashboard Overview](screenshots/16-cloudwatch-dashboard-overview.png)

* * *

### Step 1️⃣7️⃣: Dashboard – Normal CPU State

Observed dashboard metrics after CPU usage returned to normal and the alarm recovered automatically.

![Dashboard Normal State](screenshots/17-dashboard-cpu-normal-state.png)

* * *

### Step 1️⃣8️⃣: Dashboard – Alarm State Visualization

Visualized the alarm state directly on the CloudWatch dashboard when CPU utilization was high.

## 📊 Observations & Analysis

### CPU Metrics Comparison

* **Before load:** CPU utilization remained below 5%  
* **During load:** CPU utilization exceeded 80% and triggered the alarm  
* **After load:** CPU utilization returned to normal and the alarm moved back to OK  

**Explanation:**  
The stress-ng tool intentionally generated CPU load, validating real-time monitoring and alerting functionality using Amazon CloudWatch.

## 💰 Cost Awareness & Optimization

### High-Cost Resources

* EC2 compute usage  
* CloudWatch alarms and dashboards  
* Network traffic during load testing  

### Optimization Strategies

* Use burstable instance types efficiently  
* Stop or terminate idle EC2 instances  
* Reduce unnecessary monitoring retention  
* Configure AWS Budgets and cost alerts  

* * *

## ✅ Final Status

✔ Monitoring enabled  
✔ CPU alarm configured and tested  
✔ Load simulation performed  
✔ Alarm behavior verified  
✔ Dashboard created  

* * *

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This lab provided hands-on experience with AWS observability tools, real-time monitoring, alarm testing, and highlighted the importance of performance visibility and cost awareness in cloud environments.
